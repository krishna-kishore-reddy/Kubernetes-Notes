Pod Networking:

Pod: A group of containers that share the same network namespace.
Pod IP: Each pod is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster.
CNI (Container Network Interface): A plugin that manages pod networking. It creates network interfaces, assigns IP addresses, and configures routes.

Cluster Networking:

Network Plugin: A component responsible for providing network connectivity between pods and external services.
Overlay Networks: These networks create a virtual network on top of the physical network.
Routing: The network plugin handles routing between pods in different nodes.
Service Discovery: Kubernetes provides a mechanism to discover services within the cluster. This allows pods to communicate with each other without knowing their exact IP addresses.

Service Mesh:

A layer of abstraction: A service mesh provides a layer of abstraction for service-to-service communication.
Traffic Management: It handles tasks like load balancing, fault tolerance, and security.
Sidecar Proxy: Each pod typically has a sidecar proxy that handles network traffic.

Sidecar Proxy: A proxy that handles network traffic for a pod.

Common Networking Approaches:

Overlay Networks: VXLAN, Calico, Flannel, Weave Net, and Cilium are common overlay network solutions.
Host-Port Networking: Pods can be directly exposed to the host network.
IP-Per-Pod: Each pod gets its own IP address.
Additional Considerations:
Network Policies: Kubernetes allows you to define network policies to control traffic flow between pods.
Ingress Controllers: Ingress controllers handle incoming traffic to the cluster.
Load Balancing: Kubernetes provides built-in load balancing capabilities.
