To provide access to kubernetes cluster, we can provide access to them by using the following way!
We have to authenticate users by using the certificates to do so the commands as follows.

openssl genrsa -out krishnakishore.key 2048

openssl req -new -key krishnakishore.key -out krishnakishore.csr -subj "/CN=krishnakishore/O=tsi.lan"

openssl x509 -req -in krishnakishore.csr -CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out krishnakishore.crt -days 365

Then we have to create a file under user home directory named config

apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
      server: https://10.108.15.25:6443
    name: krishnakishore
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: krishnakishore
      user: krishnakishore
    name: krishnakishore@krishnakishore
current-context: krishnakishore@krishnakishore
users:
  - name: krishnakishore
    user:
      client-certificate: /home/krishnakishore/krishnakishore.crt
      client-key: /home/krishnakishore/krishnakishore.key
