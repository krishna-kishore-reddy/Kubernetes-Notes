#Liveness Probe
#Purpose: To determine if a container is alive. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container to try to recover it.
#Use Case: This is useful for situations where a container might be running but is in a bad state (e.g., stuck in an infinite loop, deadlocked, etc.) and needs to be restarted to recover.
#Types:
#HTTP GET: Kubernetes sends an HTTP GET request to the container.
#TCP Socket: Kubernetes attempts to open a TCP connection to the container.
#Exec Command: Kubernetes runs a command inside the container.




#Readiness Probe
#Purpose: To determine if a container is ready to start accepting traffic. If a readiness probe fails, the container is removed from the service's endpoints until it passes again.
#Use Case: This is useful for situations where a container needs to complete some startup tasks (like loading data or warming up caches) before it is ready to serve requests.
##Types:
#HTTP GET: Kubernetes sends an HTTP GET request to the container.
#TCP Socket: Kubernetes attempts to open a TCP connection to the container.
#Exec Command: Kubernetes runs a command inside the container.


initialDelaySeconds: Number of seconds after the container has started before the probe is initiated.
periodSeconds: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
failureThreshold: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try this many times before giving up. Giving up in case of a liveness probe means restarting the container. In case of a readiness probe, the pod will be marked Unready.
successThreshold: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having faile
